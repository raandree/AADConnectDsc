#### Enhanced Implementation ✅
- ✅ **File Location Fix**: Moved `Write-AADConnectEventLog` from Private to Public folder for proper inclusion
- ✅ **Permission-Aware Diagnostics**: Clear warnings when Administrator privileges required
- ✅ **Verbose Logging**: Always shows event logging attempts for debugging purposes
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Event logging failures don't break DSC operations

- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Non-breaking error handling with clear diagnostic messages
- ✅ **Rich Operational Context**: Rule details, complexity metrics, and operation information

#### Event ID Schema ✅
- ✅ **Compliance Events**:
  - ID 1000 (Information): Sync rule is in desired state and compliant
  - ID 1001 (Warning): Sync rule absent but should be present
  - ID 1002 (Warning): Sync rule present but should be absent
  - ID 1003 (Warning): Sync rule configuration drift detected
- ✅ **Operational Events**:
  - ID 2000 (Information): Sync rule created successfully
  - ID 2001 (Information): Sync rule updated successfully
  - ID 2002 (Information): Standard rule disabled state changed
  - ID 2003 (Information): Sync rule removed successfully

#### Testing Validation ✅
- ✅ **Module Build Success**: Version 0.4.0-eventlog0001 compiled successfully
- ✅ **Function Import**: Module imports without parser errors
- ✅ **Event Logging Access**: DSC resource classes can access event logging function
- ✅ **Permission Testing**: Confirmed behavior in both admin and non-admin environments
- ✅ **Diagnostic Output**: Verbose messages provide clear feedback about event logging attempts

### Event Log Design Details ✅
