# Progress: AADConnectDsc Status

## Latest Development Updates

### Enhanced Event Logging with Permission Diagnostics (August 7, 2025) ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem Resolution**: Successfully resolved issue where events weren't appearing when Set() method modified sync rules, particularly in non-administrator testing environments.

#### Root Cause Resolution ✅
- ✅ **Module Structure Issue**: Event logging function was in Private folder but not included in compiled module
- ✅ **Function Accessibility**: DSC resource classes couldn't access Write-AADConnectEventLog despite calling it
- ✅ **Compilation Errors**: Fixed syntax errors in help text and variable scope problems
- ✅ **Permission Handling**: Added permission-aware error messages for non-admin environments

#### Enhanced Implementation ✅
- ✅ **File Location Fix**: Moved `Write-AADConnectEventLog` from Private to Public folder for proper inclusion
- ✅ **Permission-Aware Diagnostics**: Clear warnings when Administrator privileges required
- ✅ **Verbose Logging**: Always shows event logging attempts for debugging purposes
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Event logging failures don't break DSC operations
- ✅ **Actionable Guidance**: Provides specific commands to enable event logging as Administrator

#### Event Logging Function Features ✅
- ✅ **Automatic Event Log Creation**: Creates "AADConnectDsc" event log and source when needed
- ✅ **Multi-line Event Format**: Structured information display with comprehensive context
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Non-breaking error handling with clear diagnostic messages
- ✅ **Rich Operational Context**: Rule details, complexity metrics, and operation information

#### Event ID Schema ✅
- ✅ **Compliance Events**:
  - ID 1000 (Information): Sync rule is in desired state and compliant
  - ID 1001 (Warning): Sync rule absent but should be present
  - ID 1002 (Warning): Sync rule present but should be absent
  - ID 1003 (Warning): Sync rule configuration drift detected
- ✅ **Operational Events**:
  - ID 2000 (Information): Sync rule created successfully
  - ID 2001 (Information): Sync rule updated successfully
  - ID 2002 (Information): Standard rule disabled state changed
  - ID 2003 (Information): Sync rule removed successfully

#### Testing Validation ✅
- ✅ **Module Build Success**: Version 0.4.0-eventlog0001 compiled successfully
- ✅ **Function Import**: Module imports without parser errors
- ✅ **Event Logging Access**: DSC resource classes can access event logging function
- ✅ **Permission Testing**: Confirmed behavior in both admin and non-admin environments
- ✅ **Diagnostic Output**: Verbose messages provide clear feedback about event logging attempts

### Event Log Design Details ✅
- ✅ **Dedicated Event Log**: Uses separate "AADConnectDsc" event log for clean organization
- ✅ **Structured Event IDs**: Predefined event IDs for different compliance states
- ✅ **Rich Context Information**: Includes sync rule name and connector name in event messages
- ✅ **PowerShell Best Practices**: Follows DSC community coding standards and patterns

### Standard Rule Comparison Enhancement (July 24, 2025) ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **AADSyncRule Class Enhancement**: Updated Test() method for better standard rule handling
- ✅ **Property Exclusion Logic**: Only `Name` and `Disabled` properties compared for standard rules
- ✅ **Documentation Update**: Added detailed notes about standard rule behavior
- ✅ **Example Addition**: New example showing standard rule management
- ✅ **Memory Bank Update**: Documented changes in active context

### Technical Implementation Details ✅
- ✅ **Dynamic Property Exclusion**: All properties except `Name` and `Disabled` excluded from compliance testing
- ✅ **Secondary Comparison**: Informational comparison performed without affecting test results
