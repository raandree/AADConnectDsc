# Project Brief: AADConnectDsc

## Project Overview

AADConnectDsc is a PowerShell DSC resource module designed to manage and configure Azure AD Connect synchronization engine settings. This module provides declarative configuration management for Azure AD Connect components, enabling Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approaches for identity synchronization systems.

## Core Purpose

**Primary Function**: Provide PowerShell DSC resources for managing Azure AD Connect synchronization rules, directory extension attributes, and connector configurations through declarative configuration management.

**Target Audience**: 
- Identity administrators managing Azure AD Connect deployments
- DevOps engineers implementing Infrastructure as Code for identity systems  
- System administrators maintaining hybrid identity environments
- DSC practitioners managing Windows-based identity infrastructure

## Key Problems Solved

### Manual Configuration Challenges
- **Configuration Drift**: Eliminates inconsistencies between Azure AD Connect instances
- **Manual Errors**: Reduces human error in complex sync rule configurations
- **Lack of Version Control**: Enables tracking and rollback of synchronization changes
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensures identical configuration across dev/test/prod environments

### Operational Complexity
- **Bulk Configuration**: Manages multiple sync rules and attributes through code
- **Change Management**: Provides structured approach to sync rule modifications
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting configuration through DSC resources
- **Compliance**: Enables audit trails for identity synchronization changes

## Solution Approach

### PowerShell DSC Resource Module
Implements class-based DSC resources for:
- **AADSyncRule**: Complete sync rule management including scope filters, join conditions, and attribute flow mappings
- **AADConnectDirectoryExtensionAttribute**: Directory schema extension management

### PowerShell Helper Functions
Provides public functions for:
- **Get-ADSyncRule**: Enhanced sync rule querying and filtering
- **Add/Get/Remove-AADConnectDirectoryExtensionAttribute**: Directory extension management
- **Convert-ObjectToHashtable**: Object conversion utilities

### Integration Architecture
- **Azure AD Connect SDK Integration**: Leverages Microsoft's ADSync PowerShell module
- **DSC Framework Compliance**: Follows DSC community standards and patterns
- **Class-Based Resources**: Modern PowerShell class implementations for better performance

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Manage Azure AD Connect sync rules declaratively
- ✅ Handle directory extension attributes
- ✅ Integrate with existing Azure AD Connect installations
- ✅ Support complex sync rule configurations (scope filters, join conditions, attribute flows)
- ✅ Provide PowerShell 5.0+ compatibility

### Quality Standards
- Follow DSC Community guidelines and conventions
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Support automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Integration Goals
- Seamless integration with Azure AD Connect service
- Compatibility with existing ADSync module functionality  
- Support for both custom and standard sync rules
- Enable configuration management through external systems

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- PowerShell DSC resource development
- Azure AD Connect sync rule management
- Directory extension attribute handling
- DSC community standard compliance
- Documentation and examples

### Out of Scope
- Azure AD Connect installation/upgrade
- Active Directory domain configuration
- Azure AD tenant management
- Network connectivity and firewall rules
- Windows Server DSC configuration

## Technical Context

### Dependencies
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher
- Azure AD Connect with ADSync module
- Windows PowerShell DSC framework
- .NET Framework requirements from Azure AD Connect

### Architecture
- **Module Structure**: Standard PowerShell module with Classes/, Public/, Private/ folders
- **DSC Resource Pattern**: Class-based resource implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
- **Testing Framework**: Pester tests for validation

This project serves as the foundation DSC resource layer that enables higher-level configuration management solutions for Azure AD Connect environments.
