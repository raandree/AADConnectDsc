## Installation

To install from the PowerShell Gallery:

Install-Module -Name AADConnectDsc -Repository PSGallery
```

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example of using AADConnectDsc to manage a sync rule:

```powershell
Configuration AADConnectSample {
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName AADConnectDsc
    
    Node localhost {
        AADSyncRule 'CustomUserRule' {
            Name                = 'Custom - Inbound - User - Example'
            ConnectorName       = 'contoso.com'
            Direction           = 'Inbound'
            TargetObjectType    = 'person'
            SourceObjectType    = 'user'
            LinkType            = 'Provision'
            Precedence          = 0
            Disabled            = $false
            ScopeFilter         = @(
                @{
                    ScopeConditionList = @(
                        @{
                            Attribute           = 'employeeType'
                            ComparisonOperator  = 'EQUAL'
                            ComparisonValue     = 'Employee'
                        }
                    )
                }
            )
            AttributeFlowMappings = @(
                @{
                    Source      = 'givenName'
                    Destination = 'firstName'
                    FlowType    = 'Direct'
                }
            )
            Ensure              = 'Present'
        }
    }
}

# Compile and apply the configuration
AADConnectSample -OutputPath 'C:\DSC'
Start-DscConfiguration -Path 'C:\DSC' -Wait -Verbose
```

## Event Logging

### ðŸ“Š Built-in Monitoring and Auditing

The AADConnectDsc module includes comprehensive event logging functionality
that automatically writes detailed operational events to the Windows Event Log,
enabling monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting of DSC configuration changes.

**All DSC operations are automatically logged** - no additional configuration
required!

### Event Log Location

Events are written to a dedicated event log:

- **Event Log Name**: `AADConnectDsc`
- **Event Source**: `AADConnectDsc`

View events in Event Viewer under: `Applications and Services Logs >
AADConnectDsc`

### Event Categories

The module logs two categories of events:

#### Compliance Events (Test Phase)

These events are generated when DSC checks configuration compliance:

- **Event ID 1000** (Information): Sync rule is in desired state
- **Event ID 1001** (Warning): Sync rule absent but should be present
- **Event ID 1002** (Warning): Sync rule present but should be absent
- **Event ID 1003** (Warning): Configuration drift detected

#### Operational Events (Set Phase)

These events are generated when DSC makes configuration changes:

- **Event ID 2000** (Information): Sync rule created successfully
- **Event ID 2001** (Information): Sync rule updated successfully
- **Event ID 2002** (Information): Standard sync rule disabled state changed
- **Event ID 2003** (Information): Sync rule removed successfully

### Event Information

Each event includes rich contextual information:

- Sync rule name and connector
- Direction (Inbound/Outbound)
- Object types (source and target)
- Precedence value
- Enabled/disabled state
- Rule type (Microsoft Standard or Custom)
- Operation details (for Set operations)
- Rule complexity metrics (filter groups, mappings)

### Example Event

```text
Sync rule created successfully

Sync Rule Details:
  Rule Name: Custom - Inbound - User - Department
  Connector: contoso.com
  Direction: Inbound
  Target Object Type: person
  Source Object Type: user
  Precedence: 150
  Disabled: False
  Rule Type: Custom Rule
  Operation: Create
  Rule Identifier: {12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc}
  Scope Filter Groups: 2
  Join Filter Groups: 1
  Attribute Flow Mappings: 5
```

### Monitoring and Automation

Event logging enables:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track configuration changes as they happen
- **Compliance Auditing**: Detect and report configuration drift
- **Automated Alerts**: Configure Event Viewer subscriptions or SCOM alerts
- **Change History**: Maintain audit trail of all DSC operations
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose configuration issues with detailed context
